The code for the implementation of Selective Repeat is in SenderSR.cpp and receiverSR.cpp.
The code for the implementation of Go-Back-N is in SenderGBN.cpp and receiverGBN.cpp.

Run "make" to generate all executables. 

Run both executables of any algorithm in separate terminal windows as follows.
For Selective Repeat,
./SenderSR (-d) -s <string> -p <int> -n <int> -L <int> -R <int> -N <int> -W <int> -B <int>
./receiverSR (-d) -p <int> -N <int> -n <int> -W <int> -B <int> -e <int>

For Go-Back-N,
./SenderGBN (-d) -s <string> -p <int> -l <int> -r <int> -n <int> -w <int> -b <int>
./receiverGBN (-d) -p <int> -n <int> -e <int>

"-d" is for enabling Debug mode. It is optional.
